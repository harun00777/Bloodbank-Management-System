# Bloodbank-Management-System
This project is built to maintain all the information about blood donors, patient information, and the stock of all the blood groups available in the bank. The aim is to provide transparency in this field, make the process of obtaining blood from a blood bank hassle-free and corruption-free, and make the system of blood bank management effective.
